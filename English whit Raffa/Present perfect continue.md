## Note
The present perfect continuous, rather than the present perfect, is generally used to describe a recent continuous action, especially when there is visible evidence that the action has just ended.
## Remember
The present perfect can also be used to describe a continuing action that began in the past. There is no significant difference in meaning. She’s practicedballet for years.

However, use the present perfect, not the present perfect continuous, in sentences with already, yet, before, and ever, because they describe finished actions. She’s already practicedball
